## Matrix Capsules with EM Routing - Implementation

### Matrix Capsules Layers

The core functions are implemented in 

```
/src/capsules/core.py
```

- The initialization operation to connect a regular layer to a matrix capsule layer`capsules_init()`

    This function constructs a matrix capsule layer (e.g., primaryCaps) from a regular layer.

- The convolution operation between matrix capsule layer`capsules_conv()`

    This function constructs a matrix capsule layer (e.g., ConvCaps1, ConvCaps2) from a matrix capsule layer (e.g., primaryCaps, ConvCaps1).
 
- The fully-connected operation with shared view transformation weight matrix between matrix capsule layer `capsules_fc()`

    This function constructs an output matrix capsule layer with poses and activations (e.g., Class Capsules) from a matrix capsule layer (ConvCaps2). 

- The EM routing algorithm `matrix_capsules_em_routing()`

    This function implements the matrix capsules EM routing algorithm.

### Matrix Capsules Nets

The network and loss functions are implemented in

```
/src/capsule/nets.py
```

Build a matrix capsules neural network as the same way of building CNN:

```
def capsules_net(inputs, num_classes, iterations, name='CapsuleEM-V0'):
  """Replicate the network in `Matrix Capsules with EM Routing.`
  """

  with tf.variable_scope(name) as scope:

    # inputs [N, H, W, C] -> conv2d, 5x5, strides 2, channels 32 -> nets [N, OH, OW, 32]
    nets = _conv2d_wrapper(
      inputs, shape=[5, 5, 1, 32], strides=[1, 2, 2, 1], padding='SAME', add_bias=True, activation_fn=tf.nn.relu, name='conv1'
    )
    # inputs [N, H, W, C] -> conv2d, 1x1, strides 1, channels 32x(4x4+1) -> (poses, activations)
    nets = capsules_init(
      nets, shape=[1, 1, 32, 32], strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='VALID', pose_shape=[4, 4], name='capsule_init'
    )
    # inputs: (poses, activations) -> capsule-conv 3x3x32x32x4x4, strides 2 -> (poses, activations)
    nets = capsules_conv(
      nets, shape=[3, 3, 32, 32], strides=[1, 2, 2, 1], iterations=iterations, name='capsule_conv1'
    )
    # inputs: (poses, activations) -> capsule-conv 3x3x32x32x4x4, strides 1 -> (poses, activations)
    nets = capsules_conv(
      nets, shape=[3, 3, 32, 32], strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], iterations=iterations, name='capsule_conv2'
    )
    # inputs: (poses, activations) -> capsule-fc 1x1x32x10x4x4 shared view transform matrix within each channel -> (poses, activations)
    nets = capsules_fc(
      nets, num_classes, iterations=iterations, name='capsule_fc'
    )

    poses, activations = nets

  return poses, activations
```

### TODO:

- add examples

- doc should be generated from code.
